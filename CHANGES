	* picsmap_slang2.c: RCS_BASE

	* makefile:
	add picsmap_slang2, along with temporary tie-in to build-tree for slang

	* picsmap_slang.c:
	work around slang's problems reading ncurses 6.1's "xterm-256color" entry.

2017-11-16  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* picsmap_slang.c:
	slang's interface for colors does not appear to work with -1's, and trying
	to do that triggers some code in the 24bit configuration that paints the
	screen white.  Just use black where picsmap would use default-colors.

	* picsmap_slang.c:
	add workaround to run with TERM=xterm-direct (colors aren't right, though)

2017-11-15  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* picsmap_slang.c:
	check for TERM=xterm-direct, which slang won't handle, and tell slang that
	it's really "24bit"

	* picsmap_slang.c: clear the entire background, not just the picture

	* picsmap_slang.c, cfg-slcurses, makefile, view_slcurses.c, test.priv.h, view_slang.c:
	copyright

2017-11-14  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* picsmap_slang.c: treat color-pairs as slang color-objects

	* picsmap_slang.c: add param to init_display for palette-path

	* picsmap_slang.c: start reworking the curses version of show_picture

	* picsmap_slang.c, test.priv.h: adapt initialization from view_slang

2017-11-13  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* picsmap_slang.c, test.priv.h: RCS_BASE

	* makefile: add rule for picsmap_slang

2017-11-02  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* view_slang.c: handle SIGWINCH

	* view_slang.c: implement "-c" option, like ncurses

	* view_slang.c:
	comment-out bogus "reverse-video" call from pager.c which colors the
	text "cyan".

	* view_slang.c:
	add a "-n" option to suppress line-numbers to demonstrate a limitation
	of slang's handling of double-cell characters.

2017-11-01  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* view_slang.c:
	implement -s option like ncurses, along with clock in header.

	* view_slang.c:
	show line-numbers, integrated with scrolling.  This uses 8 digits for the
	number-column, since SLscroll_xxx does tab-expansion based on the full
	width of the screen, not the window within SLsmg_set_start, etc.

	* view_slang.c: show key-names as typed, like ncurses

	* view_slang.c:
	split-out update_header, make the header not scroll left/right like the
	file contents

2017-10-31  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* view_slang.c: move title to first line, like ncurses

2017-10-16  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* with-slcurses: tie-in to discussion

2017-10-13  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* view_slang.c: add cases for compat with ncurses

	* view_slang.c: eliminate a global

	* view_slang.c: minor cleanup

	* view_slang.c: implement -i option

	* view_slang.c: be consistent on exit's

	* view_slang.c: eliminate a global

	* view_slang.c: eliminate some pointless code

	* view_slang.c: eliminate forward references

	* view_slang.c: RCS_BASE

	* makefile: sort names

	* makefile: renaming, for consistency

	* view_slcursesw.c:
	adapted my code from test/view.c to get Unicode working here.

	* makefile: add -W option

2017-10-12  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* view_slcursesw.c: adapt ch_dup from ncurses view.c

2017-09-17  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* with-slcurses: tweak per Debian #51176

2017-09-16  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* with-slcurses: fixup for waddnstr

	* with-slcurses: copy the copyright notice into the header.

	* with-slcurses: add workaround for wmove

2017-09-15  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* with-slcurses: fix case where addch was used, but waddch needed

	* with-slcurses:
	ignore slang's prototypes where I get compiler warnings that SLFUTURE_CONST
	should have fixed.  Start fixes for "-1" parameter to winchnstr, etc.

2017-09-13  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* with-slcurses: errata with inline

2017-09-06  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* with-slcurses: better copywin, but doesn't work properly yet.

	* with-slcurses:
	fix a compiler warning for mvwinch(), comment on others

	* with-slcurses: add derwin, used in my popup-msg module

	* with-slcurses:
	newterm isn't really the same as initscr, but pretending that it is allows
	redraw to "work", while none of the other programs which use newterm are
	broken.

2017-09-05  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* with-slcurses: debugged wgetnstr, making wscanw work.

	* with-slcurses: slang returns '\r' where curses would return '\n'

	* with-slcurses:
	move wgetnstr before the scanw - this makes "testscanw" partly work
	(at least, something appears on the screen).  To check my memory about
	"generally available", I found
		http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/WG14/www/docs/n701.htm
		JTC1/SC22/WG14 N701
		May 22, 1997

2017-09-04  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* with-slcurses: make unctrl/keyname act as in ncurses for 128-255

	* with-slcurses: add wgetnstr

	* with-slcurses:
	static-inline doesn't show as well in the symbol table though - make it easy to switch

	* with-slcurses:
	static-inline works just as well as extern-inline (but keep the renaming
	feature, to avoid confusion about which module they belonged to.

	* with-slcurses: add notimeout() and halfdelay()

	* with-slcurses: quick implementation of copywin

	* with-slcurses:
	turn off slcurses.h's fake for copywin/overlay, add some comments.

	* with-slcurses: add getbkgd()

	* with-slcurses: add pair_content()

	* with-slcurses: fake termname(), longname()

	* with-slcurses: fix typo in reset_prog_mode()

	* with-slcurses: add echochar

	* with-slcurses: add meta()

	* with-slcurses:
	add newterm - makes my changes to ncurses-examples less obvious :-)

	* with-slcurses: note in the generated file

	* with-slcurses: add scanw, etc.

2017-09-03  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* with-slcurses: add winnstr

	* with-slcurses: add winchnstr()

	* with-slcurses: pretend terminal's a vt100 :-)

	* with-slcurses: note stubs vs code :-)

	* with-slcurses: add stub for waddchnstr()

	* with-slcurses: corrected params for border/wborder

	* with-slcurses:
	work around multiple-definition problem when combining object-files using
	this header by using MODULE_NAME to prefix the inline function-names.

2017-09-02  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* with-slcurses:
	work around a bug in curs_set: slang does not flush output.

	* with-slcurses:
	don't use "exec" for running the resulting command, since that prevents
	"trap" from cleaning up.

	* with-slcurses: fix redefinition warnings wrt ncurses-examples

	* with-slcurses: add a corresponding keyname() function

	* with-slcurses: provide unctrl()

	* with-slcurses:
	use another level of #defines to reduce undefined symbols for ncurses-examples
	to 36.

	* with-slcurses:
	reduce the number of different undefined functions for ncurses-examples using
	the mvXXX macros

	* with-slcurses: add insert/delete line, and stubs for prog/shell mode

	* with-slcurses: add stubs for hline/vline

	* with-slcurses: add A_ATTRIBUTES and setscrreg()

	* with-slcurses:
	add several stubs and fixes for missing/incorrect stuff in slang headers

	* with-slcurses: successfully linked dots_termcap.

	* with-slcurses:
	just symlinking to curses.h does not go far enough - make a stub to allow
	customization without contaminating my configure scripts further.

	* with-slcurses: filter out the actual name of the temp-directory

2017-08-20  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* cfg-slcurses: RCS_BASE

	* with-slcurses:
	add links for more headers/libraries that my configure script looks for.

	* with-slcurses: RCS_BASE

2017-04-25  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* view_slcursesw.c: repeat the point

	* view_slcursesw.c: this won't be part of ncurses.

	* view_slcursesw.c: amend the type, adding a comment

	* view_slcursesw.c:
	my comment about addch() was oversimplified.  It sort-of recognizes color
	but of course has no useful color pairs since he allocates 8 bits for
	color PLUS video attributes, and is prone to OR'ing the fields.
	That's essentially just the 16 foreground colors - looks like it'll only
	do background color via the other interfaces, and even still insists there
	are 16 colors.

2017-03-22  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* makefile: add view_slang

	* view_slcursesw.c: RCS_BASE

	* view_slcurses.c: remove some unused stuff

2017-03-21  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* view_slcurses.c: no setscrreg - works with ASCII example now

	* view_slcurses.c: hacked in the color

	* view_slcurses.c: compiled!

	* view_slcurses.c: another missing function

	* view_slcurses.c:
	another missing function could have been done with a #define

	* view_slcurses.c: quick hack to equate slang's cell-type with cchar_t

	* view_slcurses.c:
	slcurses has no bkgd either (since it assumes everyone does bce)

	* view_slcurses.c: slang has no idlok - harmless
	slang has no keyname - make quick hack

2017-03-20  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* view_slcurses.c:
	clear away the stuff that slang won't ever do, leaving a skeleton that might
	be forced to work.

	* dots_slcurses.c: change order so that the rate message shows

	* dots_slcurses.c: builds, sort of works

	* makefile, view_slcurses.c: RCS_BASE

2014-08-09  dickey@invisible-island.net

	* dots_slcurses.c: RCS_BASE
