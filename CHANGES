	* makefile: add view_slang

	* view_slcursesw.c: RCS_BASE

	* view_slcurses.c: remove some unused stuff

2017-03-21  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* view_slcurses.c: no setscrreg - works with ASCII example now

	* view_slcurses.c: hacked in the color

	* view_slcurses.c: compiled!

	* view_slcurses.c: another missing function

	* view_slcurses.c:
	another missing function could have been done with a #define

	* view_slcurses.c: quick hack to equate slang's cell-type with cchar_t

	* view_slcurses.c:
	slcurses has no bkgd either (since it assumes everyone does bce)

	* view_slcurses.c: slang has no idlok - harmless
	slang has no keyname - make quick hack

2017-03-20  Thomas E. Dickey  <dickey@invisible-island.net>

	* view_slcurses.c:
	clear away the stuff that slang won't ever do, leaving a skeleton that might
	be forced to work.

	* dots_slcurses.c: change order so that the rate message shows

	* dots_slcurses.c: builds, sort of works

	* makefile, view_slcurses.c: RCS_BASE
